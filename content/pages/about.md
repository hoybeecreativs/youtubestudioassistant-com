  YouTube Studio Assistant was born from a simple observation: content creators spend countless hours on repetitive tasks that could be automated. We saw talented creators struggling with language barriers, SEO optimization, and the time-consuming process of crafting perfect titles and descriptions.

  Today, YouTube Studio Assistant supports 110+ languages and integrates with multiple AI providers, helping creators save 30-60 minutes per video while expanding their reach to viewers worldwide.

vision: "To become the essential companion for every YouTube creator, making professional-grade content optimization accessible to all, and helping creators focus on what they do best: creating amazing content."
